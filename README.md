# Space Invaders Remake

## Introduction
When I was a kid, I always loved arcade games, but the one that stood out to me the most was Space Invaders. I would be immersed in the game despite it's simple mechanics and repetitive level system. It is to my understanding that Dr. Racket is often considered an obselete language, but as a tribute to my childhood self and to apply the course concepts I learned in my first year at the University of British Columbia, I decided to take the initiative and create this Space Invaders Remake.

**Relavent Cource Concepts:**
- This application was built on the universe.rkt template which registers tick, render and user-input functions
- Custom data definitions and templates for sprites, missiles, lists and scoreboard statistics
- Designed compound data definitions for objects that require multiple types of data
- Leveraged local, lambda, abstract, nested and naturally recursive functions to generate alien formation
- Utlized lists of lists to define row and column positions of aliens
- Designed mutually recursive data definitions to keep loop over list data efficintly
- Followed How To Design Functions (HTDF) "recipes" to ensure proper documentation and design of each function.
- Managed real-time user input, translating key presses and mouse clicks into in-game actions, ensuring intuitive and responsive gameplay
